Make a 16x16 square of divs

Have a hover effect that turns the squares black.

Add a button to the top of the screen that clears the grid and sends a popup asking the user how many 
squares per side there should be in the new grid. (Limit: 100, same total space as before, that is, 960px)

Random RGB values

Each hover makes each square only 10% black.
